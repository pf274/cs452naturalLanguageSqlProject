# CS 452 Natural Language SQL Project

[See Website](https://pf274.github.io/cs452naturalLanguageSqlProject)

## Summary

In this project I designed a database and created a natural language interface to it using OpenAI's LLM API.

## Objective

Build an app that can ask questions of ChatGPT and get answers in the form of SQL queries to your database. Take the results of the queries (if they worked) and get ChatGPT to give a friendly answer using the results from the query on your database. Question -> GPT -> SQL -> Results -> GPT -> Friendly response. It doesn't need to have a GUI or be interactive.
